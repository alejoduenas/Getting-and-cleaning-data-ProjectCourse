=======================================
## Getting and Cleaning Data Project  

Repository for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.  

### Overview  
The collection, analysis and cleaning of a tidy data set is carried out in this project. The data used in this project and its description can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)  

### Making Modifications to This Script  
One modification to the R file is needed before you can process the data: on line 26 of run_analysis.R, you will set the path of the working directory to select the correct location of the source files
in your own directory.  

### Project Summary  
The following is a summary description of the project instructions  

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.  
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
